# Raspberry Pi Shutdown Button Script
Shutdown a Raspberry Pi through a momentary push button connected to one of the PGIO pins. In this implementation the GPIO 2 pin is used. However, this can be changed by changing the `button_pin` variable in the script to the BCM number of your wanted GPIO pin.
